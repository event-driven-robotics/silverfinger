# silverfinger
Metallised coiled finger prototype fabricated by Protoelectronics 2021.

![curvaceous PCB design which results from code in pcb branch](images/silverfinger_layout.jpg)

Includes PCB design, which is python code which elaborates kicad templates to create kicad source.

Also includes arduino code for testing prototypes. This includes:

+ interfacing to icub standard capacitive sensor IC.
+ using arduino directly to pulse plates to explore inter-whisker capacitances.
